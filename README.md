# vue-my-table
I'm a data table UI, and I'm hungry for data!  Give me an endpoint and I'll get your data. Then I'll wrap it up in a cozy UI for you, which you can configure.  I don't do ajax, now, not yet anyway.  My creator says I'm not ready. But for sorting and filtering data on-page, I'm your top choice!
